# Introduction to Vulkan

The goal here is to help me wrap my head around Vulkan so I can start building more
advanced rendering engines.

## Reference

The code here is mainly taken from the [Vulkan Guide](https://vkguide.dev/), though it may
incorporate more things from other places as I progress. The code is adapted to use
Vulkan-HPP instead of the C-API for the sake of simplicity (and since we're going to be
using C++ anyway).

## Dependencies

This is a (probably incomplete) list of dependencies, mostly for reference:

| SDK | Version |
|-----|---------|

| Zeus | Latest |
| GLM | Latest |
| GLFW3 | 3.3.6 |
